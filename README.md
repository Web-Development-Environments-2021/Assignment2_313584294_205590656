## Functionality:

  1. We added two types of candies: Cherry and Strawberry, that appear and dissapear throughout the game. When the pacman eats one of the candies, 30 points are added to the score.
  2. We added a clock on the board. When the pacman eats the clock, 20 seconds are added to the game.
  3. Extra: We added a sound effect and picture when the pacman and monster collide, and we added a sound effect at the end of the game.
